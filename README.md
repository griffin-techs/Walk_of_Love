# For Sheila — a website from Jack 💌

A one-of-one love letter built as an interactive site. Multiple sections, hidden interactions, a daily-changing note, a soundtrack, a "diary" with question-locked entries, and a reply form so it becomes a conversation, not a monologue.

Built on Lovable (TanStack Start + React + Tailwind + Lovable Cloud/Supabase).

## 🧭 Side menu (left sidebar)

A collapsible left-side navigation lives at the top-left corner (the ☰ button). It's **closed by default**, opens on tap, closes on `Esc` or by clicking outside.

- All sections are listed in order with an emoji + label.
- Clicking an item smooth-scrolls to that section.
- Source: `src/components/SideNav.tsx` — edit the `SECTIONS` array there to add/rename/reorder links. Each link's `id` must match the `<div id="...">` wrapper in `src/routes/index.tsx`.

## 🎂 Birthday Vault dates (edit these!)

Time-released cards in `src/components/BirthdayVault.tsx` → `CARDS` array. Each card auto-unlocks on its `month/day` (months are 1-12). Update with her real dates:

| Card | Default date | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| her birthday | 7/14 | the big one |
| our anniversary | 3/22 | the day she said yes to all this |
| christmas | 12/25 | warm-light-in-the-window |
| surprise #1 | 2/14 | valentine's, louder |
| surprise #2 | 5/1 | just because, spring |
| surprise #3 | 9/9 | first hoodie morning |
| surprise #4 | 11/11 | 11:11 wish |

Locked cards show a countdown and a "peek" button that only teases — they only truly unlock on the date.

## 📸 Photo Album controls

Each polaroid frame in the Photo Album has a **⋯ menu** (top-right, on hover) with:
- **Upload / Replace photo** — picks a local image, stored as base64 in `localStorage` (`photo-album-frames-v1`)
- **Edit caption** — inline textarea + save/cancel
- **Delete photo** — clears the image, keeps the caption + frame

Tap an empty frame anywhere to open the file picker. All edits persist per-browser.

## 🔑 Diary unlock answers — cheat sheet (for Jack only)

Each diary entry shows a random question from the pool below. Hints appear after 5 wrong tries. Answers are case-insensitive and ignore punctuation.

| # | Question | Accepted answers | Hint chips (correct in **bold**) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | what did Jack burn the first time he cooked for you? | `rice` / `the rice` / `white rice` | pasta · **rice** · eggs |
| 2 | what does Jack secretly call you when no one's listening? | `babe` / `baby` / `my baby` | honey · **babe** · queen |
| 3 | what's your made-up nickname for Jack? | `jacky` / `jackie` / `jay` | **jacky** · j-man · jackson |
| 4 | where's our dreamland? | `zanzibar` / `bora bora` / `borabora` / `dubai` | paris · **zanzibar** · tokyo |
| 5 | how many kids do we keep saying we'll have? | `2` / `two` / `3` / `three` | 1 · **2** · 5 |
| 6 | where did we first meet? | `instagram` / `online` / `ig` / `dm` / `dms` | tinder · **instagram** · a wedding |
| 7 | you're my favorite ___ | `person` / `human` / `everything` | **person** · headache · snack |
| 8 | what do I always steal from your plate? | `fries` / `chips` / `the fries` | **fries** · chicken · dessert |

Edit these in `src/components/Diary.tsx` → `QUESTIONS` array.

### How the lock works now
- First entry shows the question form open by default.
- Every other entry is blurred with an **"unlock to see ❤"** button.
- Clicking the button reveals that entry's question. Correct answer → full entry. Wrong → cute tease + fail counter.
- 5 wrong guesses on any entry → hint chips appear (one is correct).
- Each entry has its own independent unlock state (saved in `localStorage`).
